= Parameters

The parent key for all of the following parameters is `openshift4_olm`.

== `disableAllDefaultSources`

[horizontal]
type:: boolean
default:: false

When set to `true`, this parameter disables all default OperatorHub catalog sources in the OpenShift cluster.
This is useful when you want to manage catalog sources exclusively through this component and prevent any default sources from being available.

== `catalogSources`

[horizontal]
type:: dict
default:: {}

A dictionary that defines the OperatorHub catalog sources to be created in the OpenShift cluster.
Each catalog source can be configured with its own settings such as source type, image, display name, and publisher information.
This allows you to customize which operator catalogs are available in your cluster.
